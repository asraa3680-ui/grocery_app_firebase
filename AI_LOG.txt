Project Name: Smart Grocery App

Student: Asraa

AI Usage Summary:

Code Architecture & Restructuring: The AI assisted in migrating the project from a single-file structure to a professional Clean Architecture (Models, Providers, Screens). This ensured better code maintainability and followed Flutter best practices.

Data Modeling & JSON Serialization (Week 1 Requirement): The AI helped in creating the GroceryItem model and implementing fromJson and toJson methods. This was crucial for handling data from Cloud Firestore efficiently and meeting the project's technical requirements.

State Management (Provider): The AI guided the implementation of the Provider Pattern. We moved all Firebase logic (CRUD operations) into a GroceryProvider class, separating the business logic from the UI.

Advanced Features Implementation:

Search: Developed a real-time search filter for the grocery list.

Update/Edit: Implemented logic to update both item names and quantities in Firestore.

Authentication: Refined the login/logout flow using Firebase Auth.

Git & Deployment Support: The AI provided technical support for resolving Git conflicts and using advanced commands (like force push) to ensure the repository was correctly updated after restructuring.

UI/UX Customization: Assisted in styling the app with a consistent Dark Blue theme and ensuring the UI remained user-friendly and clear.
